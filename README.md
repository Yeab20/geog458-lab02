# Lab 02 – Web Data Collection and Visualization

## Topic and Search Parameters
This project explores how Black culture, Black identity, and Black history are represented on YouTube. 
I collected video data using three search terms:
- Black culture
- Black identity
- Black history

For each search term, I used a Selenium-based web crawler to collect video metadata and descriptions from YouTube search results.

## Why This Comparison
These three terms describe related but distinct dimensions of Black experience. 
Comparing them allows for an examination of how cultural expression, identity formation, and historical memory are framed differently on YouTube.

## Word Cloud Comparison

### Black Culture

The Black culture word cloud emphasizes creativity, expression, and influence. 
Words related to music, media, and popular culture appear frequently, highlighting how Black culture is often framed through entertainment and visibility.

### Black Identity

The Black identity word cloud focuses on self-definition, belonging, and labeling.
Terms related to race, diaspora, and identity politics appear more often, reflecting ongoing debates around who defines Blackness and how identity is constructed.

### Black History

The Black history word cloud highlights themes of erasure, legacy, and resistance.
Words connected to slavery, civil rights, and historical correction appear frequently, showing how Black history is often framed as something that must be recovered or reclaimed.

## Interpretation of Patterns
The differences among the word clouds suggest that YouTube content frames Black culture as present-focused, Black identity as contested and political, and Black history as corrective and educational. 
These patterns likely reflect both the platform’s recommendation system and the types of creators producing content under each search term.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
This research could be improved by increasing the number of scrolls, expanding the number of search terms, or comparing results across different geographic locations.
Further filtering of irrelevant content could also improve the clarity of the word clouds.

## Unexpected Findings
One unexpected finding was how strongly entertainment-related content dominated the Black culture search, while Black history content focused heavily on erasure and correction rather than celebration.
